        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pork pie recipe is a standard Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve treat in my predominantly French Canadian hometown in Maine. It's served with catsup or mustard, tossed salad, and pickles. Simple but wonderful. Top individual servings with catsup or mustard before serving.
